## This is my first blogging endeavour

I've written blogs, usually in blogger. But always wanted to maintain own server, so that I can experiment things in production.
This is one of such experiments. Using git as the source of truth, so that I don't have to mess with dbs. And Hugo as the site generator.
As of now, this blog is powered by
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The awesome static site generator.
- Awesome Theme, [Hugo Theme Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal)
- DigitalOcean free tier app(Huge thanks to them).
